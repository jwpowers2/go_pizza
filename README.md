# Go Pizza

# this is a project for me to practice algorithms in golang

# there is an order queue, a linked list

# there is an array of ingredients, you can add an ingredient and the list will be sorted

# the sorted array of ingredients will be searched using Binary Search

# what about the customer list?  make a non-directed graph of customers and their preferences

# can make a directed graph, trie set, for an autocomplete

no DB, all is stored in memory
there is a menu up top, link for customer, link for restaurant worker, link to business intelligence page

story one: user wants to order a pizza, they pull up order page, add ingredients
if ingredients they want are not there, they add them to the list

order goes into the queue

store two: restaurant worker look at teh queue, takes oldest order off the queue, completing the order
order info is entered into the customer relationship graph

store three is graphing, BI page
